## other important stuff

> this repostory was generated from the [bill-richards/jekyll-site-template](https://github.com/bill-richards/jekyll-site-template), a [_template_](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) repository, which itself uses [bill-richards/jekyll-site-cookiecutter](https://github.com/bill-richards/jekyll-site-cookiecutter), a _cookiecutter_ repository. go check them out to see how they work together, it's a pretty cool concept -sadly though, i cannot take the credit for it, i was inspired by the [simonw/python-lib-template-repository](https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository) repository by [simonw](https://github.com/simonw)
