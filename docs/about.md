## Other important stuff

> This repostory was generated from the [bill-richards/jekyll-site-template](https://github.com/bill-richards/jekyll-site-template), a [_template_]((https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)) repository, which itself uses [bill-richards/jekyll-site-cookiecutter](https://github.com/bill-richards/jekyll-site-cookiecutter), a _cookiecutter_ repository. Go check them out to see how they work together, it's a pretty cool concept -and sadly I cannot take the credit for it, I was inspired by [this](https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository) repository by [simonw](https://github.com/simonw)
