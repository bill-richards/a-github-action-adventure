the idea is to present here that which is involved in learning how to leverage the goodness that is github. there are various tools available to use -whether one has a free account, or a paid for one, whether it's a personal account or an organization account- and I am attempting to put together the information you will need in order to take advantage of these tools.

as such, the repository attached to this website is intended to be forked or cloned and further disected at your leisure. i have tried to put some really helpful comments into the code files along the way, and i am trying desperately to keep this website up to date ... 

there's a lot of information to digest in here, so buckle up, put your thinking cap on, and get ready for one heck of a ride as we explore github and all it has to offer.

or as my favourite quote says[^1]

- by the way, you can't push anything to this repository, so you're better off forking if you want to keep your changes

[_git submodules_](/content/git/submodules.md)

- what they are, why you want them, and how you use them. _(they're actually a great boon when it comes to organizing your projects)_

[^2]: Lincoln was actually assassinated in _1865_
[^3]: and the internet didn't really get started until the late _1950s_
